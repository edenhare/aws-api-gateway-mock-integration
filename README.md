# Sample Code for Building an API Gateway Mock Integration

This repository contains the sample code described in the MEdium article *Building an API Gateway Mock Integration*, by Chris Hare.

There are three directories: 
- cdk, containing the CDK files to deploy an API Gateway with a mock integration;
- cfn, containing a YAML formatted CloudFormation template to deploy an API Gateway with a mock integration; and,
- terraform, containing the files  to deploy an API Gateway with a mock integration using the Terraform Configuration Language.
